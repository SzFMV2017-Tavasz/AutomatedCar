/**
 * This class represent a single signal on the bus.
 * Signals can be handled by implementing the ISystemComponent interface.
 *
 * In a real environment signals are encapsulated by frames (terminology depends on the network)
 * and a frame can contain several signals. This way the throughput of the network is utilized
 * more efficiently.
 *
 * For the simulation environment let's assume that each frame contains a single message,
 * so we do not need to bother extracting signal data from frames.
 *
 * Students must not modify this class!
